Lyra was initially launched with ShooterCore and ShooterMaps but in the later releases they created ShooterExplorer which has a more fleshed out inventory system. This would suggest to break the project down into the greatest common denominators and build from there. Creating a new [[Game Feature]] for each imported asset set may clutter larger projects so it may be more feasible, as an example, to create one per playable character with relevant cosmetics and unique abilities or one that holds all NPC's.

## Game Feature References

[[Game Features]] only have access to content that they directly reference so a new reference must be manually added for each one. The only exception that has been encountered is maps being allowed to be assigned to [[LyraUserFacingExperienceDefinition]].
