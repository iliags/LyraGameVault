#DataAsset


This [[Game Feature]] that holds the base logic for the game and game modes; a [[Data Asset]] with the name of the module is automatically generated.

When making changes to the Asset Manager section, an editor restart may be required for the changes to take effect. Content that needs outside access must have their types added to this section; reference the ShooterCore [[Game Feature]] for an example.
