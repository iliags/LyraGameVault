The **Game Features** and **Modular Gameplay** plugins help developers create standalone features for their projects. Building features with these plugins offers several benefits, including keeping your project's codebase clean and readable, and avoiding accidental interactions or dependencies between unrelated features. This is particularly important when developing live products that change their feature sets over time.
