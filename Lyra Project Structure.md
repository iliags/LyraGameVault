Lyra is structured to load [[Game Features]] based on the GameFeatureData [[Data Asset]] at the content root. This is automatically generated by the editor when the [[Game Feature]] is created.

## Gameplay Tags

Each [[Game Feature]] has their own gameplay tags file but the editor likes to default to the one that is in the main project.
