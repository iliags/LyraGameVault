The Dragon Realm project is based on the Lyra Starter game from Epic; it provides a base game framework for multiplayer games to jump-start new projects. `MyGame` is used as the project name but it should be replaced with the actual project name.

This is meant as a crash-course set of documentation to get running in Lyra quickly so there is the assumption that the reader has at least an intermediate level of Unreal knowledge.
